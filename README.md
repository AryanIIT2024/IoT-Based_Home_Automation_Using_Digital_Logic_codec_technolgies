# 🚦 Traffic Light Controller using Verilog (FSM Based)

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Traffic Light Controller** using **Finite State Machine (FSM)** logic written in Verilog HDL.
The design simulates real traffic signal behavior for multiple roads with timed transitions between **Green, Yellow, and Red** lights.

It is designed for:

* FPGA implementation
* Digital design learning
* VLSI / Embedded systems practice

---

## ⚙️ Features

* FSM-based state control
* Configurable timing using counters
* Separate signals for multiple roads:

  * Main Road 1
  * Main Turning
  * Main Road 2
  * Side Road
* Fully synthesizable design
* Behavioral simulation supported

---

## 🧠 Working Principle

The controller works as a **sequential logic system**:

1. Current state stored in register (`p_state`)
2. Counter generates delay timing
3. When timer expires → state transitions
4. Output lights update according to state

State sequence:

```
S1 → S2 → S3 → S4 → S5 → S6 → repeat
```

Each state represents a traffic phase.

## ⏱ Timing Logic

Instead of real-time seconds, delays are implemented using clock cycles.

Example:

```
sec_7 = 7 clock cycles
sec_5 = 5 clock cycles
sec_3 = 3 clock cycles
sec_2 = 2 clock cycles
```

---

## 💡 Light Encoding

Each light uses 3-bit output:

```
001 → Green
010 → Yellow
100 → Red
```
